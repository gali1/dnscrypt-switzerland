First you have to Install unbound, i did it like this

```
apt update && apt install unbound libevent-dev openssl
```

then i updated the unbound binary file by installing from sources

```
wget http://www.unbound.net/downloads/unbound-latest.tar.gz
tar -xvf unbound
cd unbound-1.7.3/
./configure --with-libevent --enable-dnscrypt  #https://www.unbound.net/documentation/howto_optimise.html
make && make install
service unbound stop
cp /usr/sbin/unbound /usr/sbin/unbound-org
cp /usr/local/sbin/unbound /usr/sbin/unbound
service unbound restart
service unbound status

```
it need also libevent (http://libevent.org/), libsodium (https://download.libsodium.org/doc/installation/), dnscrypt-wrapper (https://github.com/cofyc/dnscrypt-wrapper) and openssl (https://www.openssl.org/)

all needed config files are in the github repo free to download, edit and use

be sure, that your /etc/unbound/ folder is owned by unbound:unbound 

you could test it with 

dig ns google.com @127.0.1.1 #standard internet
dig ns opennic.glue @127.0.1.1 #opennic internet

if it runs, configure your router to forward port 443 or 8443 (it belongs what you configure in the unbound.conf or in the unbound.conf.d/dnscrypt.conf) to your unbound server

to get updated with the root.hints and the dnscrypt certs, you could copy the cron.daily script i uploaded
