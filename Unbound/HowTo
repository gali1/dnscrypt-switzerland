First you have to Install unbound, i did it like this


```
apt update && apt install unbound
```

then i updated the unbound binary file by installing from sources

```
wget http://www.unbound.net/downloads/unbound-latest.tar.gz
tar -xvf unbound
cd unbound-1.7.3/
./configure --with-libevent --enable-dnscrypt  #https://www.unbound.net/documentation/howto_optimise.html
make && make install
service unbound stop
cp /usr/sbin/unbound /usr/sbin/unbound-org
cp /usr/local/sbin/unbound /usr/sbin/unbound
service unbound restart
service unbound status

```
